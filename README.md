### Hi, my name is Victor Marotta - [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/victor-marotta-5055ab60)

I'm a Surveyor and Cartographer Engineer by formation, but a Software Engineer by trade. I've been developing Web-based Geographic Information Systems (WebGIS) by myself over the last years and lately I've been involved in coordinating teams of developers with the same goal. 

I work as a Full Stack Developer with a DevOps inclination, I usually like to structure the whole cycle of the application: design, requirements, architecture, coding, automation, continuous integration and continuous delivery. I'm mostly skilled in JavaScript/TypeScript and React, but I can handle myself well around other JS/TS frameworks (or even VanillaJS), Python, Rust and other languages. 

Checkout my public repos to see what I've been working on lately :)
